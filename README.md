# react-tournament-brackets
Forked from [@g-loot/react-tournament-brackets](https://github.com/g-loot/react-tournament-brackets) with fixed graphics and a compact layout

## Changes
 - Fixed issue where connector line doesn't line up with boxes
 - Made _much_ more compact to fit more matches
 - 2nd final in double elimination tournaments renamed to 'Grand Final' to keep remaining match titles accurate
 - Minor misc graphics fixes

Note: these changes have only been tested on the Double Elimination tournament style.
